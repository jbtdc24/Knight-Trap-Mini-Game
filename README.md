# Knight Trap - Arcade Survival Game

A high-speed arcade survival and score attack game built with React.js and Pixi.js.

## Game Features

### Core Mechanics
- **6x6 Grid Board**: Navigate your white knight (‚ôò) on a chess board
- **AI Opponents**: Two black knights (‚ôû) that actively try to trap you
- **Dynamic Void System**: Previously occupied squares become deadly red void tiles
- **Rapid Timer**: Make moves before the timer expires or lose instantly
- **Power-ups**: Collect special abilities to survive longer

### Scoring System
- **+1 point** for each safe, legal move
- **+10 points** for capturing a black knight
- **Void Depth**: Increases every 5 captures (max 20), making more squares dangerous

### Power-ups
- **‚≠ê Time Warp**: Instantly resets the move timer
- **üõ°Ô∏è Void Shield**: Grants 2 moves of protection from void creation
- **‚ö° Aether Blast**: Teleports both black knights to opposite corners

### AI Behavior
The black knights use tactical AI that:
- Minimizes your safe escape routes
- Actively tries to force checkmate-like traps
- Respawns instantly when captured
